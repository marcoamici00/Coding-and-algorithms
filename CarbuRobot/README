**Search Algorithms Project**

CarbuRobot is a search and planning simulation project in which a robot operates in a fuel-constrained environment. The robot must move between rooms, manipulate objects, and compute an optimal sequence of actions to reach a predefined goal state.

The project implements and compares multiple classical search algorithms, analyzing their performance in terms of execution time and explored nodes.

_Problem Description_

The robot operates in a sequence of rooms and can perform the following actions:

* **move** → move between adjacent rooms
* **get** → pick up an object
* **put** → drop an object
* **refill** → refill fuel at a fuel station

_Constraints:_

* The robot can carry **only one object at a time**
* Each object has a weight that affects fuel consumption
* Moving without an object costs **1 fuel unit**
* Moving with an loaded object costs **weight + 1**
* Picking up or dropping an object costs fuel equal to its weight
* Refilling increases fuel by a fixed amount

The objective is to reach a goal configuration including robot position, object placement, and valid fuel constraints.

**Implemented Algorithms**

The project includes the implementation and comparison of:

* **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
* **Uniform Cost Search**
* **A* Search**

Each algorithm is evaluated based on:

* number of explored nodes
* solution path
* execution time

---

**Heuristics**

Two heuristics are used with A* search:

* **h1 – Misplaced Objects Heuristic**
  Counts the number of objects not in their goal positions

* **h2 – Misplaced Rooms Heuristic**
  Counts rooms containing incorrect objects

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook

Install Jupyter (if needed):

```
pip install notebook
```

**How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd CarbuRobot
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `carburobot.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to execute simulations and evaluations

---

**Test Scenarios**

The notebook includes three test problems with increasing complexity:

* **Problem 1:** simple object relocation
* **Problem 2:** multiple objects with required refueling
* **Problem 3:** complex planning with multiple refills

---

**Results Summary**

Experimental results show that heuristic search (A*) significantly reduces explored nodes and execution time compared to uninformed search algorithms. The second heuristic (h2) generally provides the best performance.
